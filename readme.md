# Meet Dissy!

Discord's smartest and sassiest bot. Dissy is designed from the bottom up to be modular in all her functions.
She's pretty barebones right now, but I'm working on having her eventually be 100% maintained from chat.

One distinct feature of Dissy is that if one modular fails, she will promptly purge it and remove it from her !help menu.
With this, she is able to have a 100% uptime if the host does not have any external problems.

# But how?

Simply fork, build, run. Oh, but first you need one specific environment variable!
Your bot key from discord. Create a bot and when you receive your Secret Key, create a user or system environment
variable called `DissySecret` and set it to your Secret Key. Then you're good to go! 

Have fun!
