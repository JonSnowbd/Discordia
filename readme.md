# Meet Maid!

Discord's smartest and sassiest bot. Maid is designed from the bottom up to be modular in all her functions.

One distinct feature of Maid is that if one modular fails, she will promptly purge it and remove it from her !help menu.
With this, she is able to have a 100% uptime if the host does not have any external problems.

# But why?

I wanted to make a bot that met all my needs within an online community known as a guild, or in FFXIV's case, Free Company.
Maid will soon be the bot to handle raid times and information bot, and yours if you so want(either now by hosting her yourself
or later when she is stable, you can invite her to your FFXIV Free Company discord.

# But how?

Simply fork, build(The Maid assembly), run(The MaidConsole project). Oh, but first you need one specific environment variable!
Your bot key from discord. Create a bot and when you receive your Secret Key, create a user or system environment
variable called `MaidToken` and set it to your Secret Key. Then you're good to go! 

Have fun!
